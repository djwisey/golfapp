# Golf App

This repository contains a SwiftUI iOS client and an Express backend. The app
loads course data from the backend at runtime.

## Getting Started

1. Install backend dependencies and start the API:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
2. Run the iOS app (`golfy` target) in Xcode or `swift run` to see the Shetland
   course pulled from the backend.
